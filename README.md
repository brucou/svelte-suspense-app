## Motivation
This is a proof of concept for offering functionality similar to that of React Suspense. It is 
inspired from [previous work](https://reactgo.com/tutorial-reactlazy-react-suspense/) by [Sai 
gowtham](https://twitter.com/saigowthamr) that I reimplemented here with Svelte in lieu of React.

## What it is

## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
now
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.
